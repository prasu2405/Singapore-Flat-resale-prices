## Project overview
The "Singapore Resale Flat Prices Predicting" project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of flats in Singapore. Utilizing historical data on resale flat transactions, the project seeks to provide potential buyers and sellers with a tool to estimate the resale value of a flat. 

## Problem Statement:
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.

## Objectives

- **Develop a Predictive Model:** Create a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the resale prices of flats based on historical transaction data.
- **Deploy a User-Friendly Web Application:** Implement the predictive model within a Streamlit-based web application to make it accessible and user-friendly for end-users.
- **Assist Stakeholders:** Provide valuable insights and predictions to potential buyers, sellers, real estate agents, and market analysts to help them make informed decisions.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project will be sourced from publicly available datasets provided by Singapore government agencies such as the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and Data.gov.sg.

## Approach
The project encompasses the following key steps:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather and preprocess historical resale flat transaction data from reliable sources.
- **Feature Engineering:** Identify and engineer relevant features that significantly impact resale flat prices.
- **Model Selection and Training:** Evaluate different machine learning algorithms and select the most suitable model. Train the model using the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
- **Streamlit Web Application:** Develop an interactive web application using Streamlit to deploy the predictive model.
- **Deployment on Render:** Host the web application on Render for public access.
- **Testing and Validation:** Rigorously test and validate the application to ensure it meets user needs and performs well in a real-world scenario.
